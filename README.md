# Sonic Music

With each iteration of my personal website, I challenge myself to implement new frameworks, coding practices, and features to enhance my website's efficiency and complexity.

## Languages/Tools

- Java

## Key Features

- **üéß Custom Playlists:** Create an account to modify and store your custom playlists.
- **üñºÔ∏è Image Emotion & Colour Analysis:** Upload an image and extract related emotions and objects based on its dominant colors.
- **üéº Spotify Playlist Curation:** Automatically curate a Spotify playlist based on information extracted from your image.
  
## Technical Breakdown

- **K-means Clustering Algorithm:** Formulated a k-means++ clustering algorithm that identifies dominant colors in an image by iteratively updating centroid positions until convergence in under 2 seconds.
- **API Integration:** Developed GET and POST requests for the Color API and DataMuse API, parsing JSON responses for data retrieval and manipulation.
- **Spotify Web API:** Built API endpoints to the Spotify Web API, enabling users to retrieve songs, modify, and save playlists.
